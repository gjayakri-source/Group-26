# PharmaSupplyChain

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based supply chain management system to track pharmaceutical products and raw materials throughout their lifecycle.  

The system ensures **transparency, authenticity, and traceability** in the pharmaceutical ecosystem using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity.  

Key features include:
- Immutable record keeping for raw materials and products  
- Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin’s `AccessControl`  
- Event logging for complete traceability  
- Product provenance verification  
- Security protections via OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard`  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Solidity (v0.8.x)** – Smart contract language  
- **Remix IDE** – Online IDE for writing, compiling, and deploying contracts  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet for deploying and interacting with contracts on Ethereum networks  
- **Ethereum** – Blockchain platform (testnets like Sepolia/Goerli recommended)  
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** – Standard libraries for access control and security
